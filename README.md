# RSNA-21-brain-tumor-detection 
detects brain tumor based on MGMT values and MRI images 


# significance of the MGMT values in the brain tumor detection 
there are 4 kind of MRI images in the dataset 
* FLAIR
* T1w
* T1wCE
* T2w
## FLAIR type in MRI images : 
FLAIR consists horizontal brain images they contribute most towards detecting brain tumor in patients 

## MGMT values: 
MGMT (O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme. This enzyme rescues tumor cells from alkylating agent-induced damage, and this leads to resistance to chemotherapy with alkylating agents. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation results in decreased MGMT protein expression, reduced DNA repair activity, and potential increased sensitivity to therapy. MGMT promoter methylation status has been most widely evaluated by methylation-specific PCR method, which is both sensitive and specific.
